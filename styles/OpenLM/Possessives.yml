  # General OpenLM possessives
- OpenLM's
- OpenLM Server's
- OpenLM Agent's
- OpenLM Broker's
- OpenLM Portal's
- OpenLM User Portal's
- OpenLM License Manager's
- Options File's # If referring to the OpenLM Options File

# Possessives related to OpenLM features/components (add as needed)
- License Usage's
- Feature Management's
- User Management's
- Alerting System's
- Reporting Module's
- Integration's # If referring to integrations with other systems

# Possessives related to technologies OpenLM interacts with (if contextually relevant and frequent)
- Database's # If generally discussing database aspects related to OpenLM
- API's # If generally discussing the OpenLM API
- System's # If generally discussing the system OpenLM monitors

# Specific product/technology possessives (use sparingly and only if frequently referenced with the possessive)
- Observability Cloud's # If OpenLM documentation frequently refers to its integration with this specific product in a possessive way.
- OpenTelemetry's # Same as above.
- Agent's # If referring to a specific agent type relevant to OpenLM (e.g., "the Windows Agent's configuration"). Be mindful this could be ambiguous.
- Collector's # Same as Agent's.
- Connector's # Same as Agent's.

# Consider rephrasing to avoid possessives where possible. For example, instead of:
# - "The Agent's configuration file."
# Consider:
# - "The configuration file for the Agent."
# - "Agent configuration file."

# If a possessive is unavoidable and not explicitly listed above, Vale might flag it based on a general possessive rule. You can add specific exceptions here if necessary.
