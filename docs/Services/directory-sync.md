# Directory Sync

Directory Sync allows you to synchronize user and group data from your directory service to your application. This guide provides an overview of the configurations and features available for Directory Sync.

## Configurations

###  Directory service integration

- **Supported services**: Integrate with popular directory services such as Active Directory, Azure AD, and LDAP.  
- **Connection setup**: Configure secure connections using SSL/TLS.  
- **Authentication**: Use service accounts or API tokens for authentication.  

###  Synchronization settings

- **Sync frequency**: Choose between manual, scheduled, or real-time synchronization.  
- **Scope selection**: Define specific organizational units (OUs) or groups to sync.  
- **Conflict resolution**: Configure rules for handling duplicate or conflicting data.  

### User and group mapping

- **Attribute mapping**: Map directory attributes to application fields (e.g., email, username).  
- **Group assignments**: Automatically assign roles or permissions based on group membership.  
- **Custom attributes**: Add custom fields to extend user profiles.  

## Features

###  Real-time updates

- Automatically sync changes in your directory to keep user data up to date.  

### Audit logs

- Track synchronization activities with detailed logs for compliance and troubleshooting.  

### Error handling

- Receive notifications for sync errors and retry failed operations.  

### Scalability

- Support for large directories with thousands of users and groups.  
### Security

Directory Sync ensures secure synchronization between your company's Active Directory and OpenLM. Key security features include:

- **Encrypted connections**: All data transfers are secured using SSL/TLS encryption.  
- **Access control**: Only authorized service accounts or API tokens can initiate synchronization.  
- **Data privacy**: Sensitive user and group information is handled in compliance with industry standards.  
- **Audit trails**: Detailed logs are maintained for all synchronization activities to support compliance and troubleshooting.  
- **Error notifications**: Immediate alerts for any security-related issues during synchronization.  

- Ensure data integrity with encrypted connections and secure authentication methods.  

## Best practices

- Regularly review synchronization logs to identify and resolve issues.  
- Limit the scope of synchronization to only necessary users and groups.  
- Test configurations in a staging environment before applying them to production.  

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Verify network settings and SSL/TLS certificates.  
- **Data mismatches**: Check attribute mappings and synchronization rules.  
- **Performance concerns**: Optimize sync frequency and scope for large directories.
