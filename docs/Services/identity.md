# Identity Service

This document provides an overview of the configurations and features available in the Identity Service.

## Overview

The Identity Service is a centralized system for managing user authentication and authorization. It ensures secure access to applications and services by providing robust identity management capabilities.

## Configurations

### Authentication methods

The Identity Service supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Single sign-on (SSO):** Enables users to log in once and access multiple applications.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification steps.
- **Password-based authentication:** Standard username and password login.

### User roles and permissions

Administrators can configure user roles and permissions to control access to resources:

- **Role-based access control (RBAC):** Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities.
- **Custom permissions:** Define granular access controls for specific resources.

### API integration

The Identity Service provides APIs for seamless integration with third-party applications:

- **OAuth 2.0:** Secure authorization framework for accessing resources.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

## Features

### User management

- **User provisioning:** Add, update, or remove users in bulk or individually.
- **Self-service portal:** Allow users to manage their profiles and reset passwords.

### Security features

- **Audit logging:** Track user activities and system changes for compliance.
- **Session management:** Monitor and terminate active sessions as needed.
- **Encryption:** Protect sensitive data with industry-standard encryption protocols.

### Scalability and reliability

- **High availability:** Ensure uninterrupted service with failover mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Handle growing user bases with horizontal scaling.
