# Software Asset Management (SAM)

## Overview

Software Asset Management helps manage software licenses by tracking seller details, purchases, and entitlement records. It captures information such as purchase cost, purchase date, pricing type (**Perpetual**, **Maintenance**, **Subscription-Based**), license validity periods, and maintenance terms. The module integrates with license servers to retrieve license details and workstations for gathering software usage information.

Entitlement records feed into the reporting service, enabling administrators to generate comprehensive reports.
