### Edit an agent's properties

To edit agent details:

1. Double-click the agent row (or select **Edit Agent** icon), then open **Advanced Settings**.
2. Adjust required fields:
   - **Agent Name**: Unique agent identifier.
   - **Description (optional)**: Notes for identification.
   - **Status**:
     - **Enabled**: Agent operational.
     - **Suspended**: Sync paused until re-enabled.
   - **Agent request interval**: Frequency (in seconds) agent checks for sync jobs (range: 5-600 seconds).
   - **Sync method**:
     - **Parallel**: Runs multiple syncs concurrently.
     - **Serial**: Runs syncs sequentially (FIFO).
3. Select **Save Changes**.

### Edit agent properties in bulk

To bulk edit agent properties:

1. Select multiple agents by checking boxes.
2. Click **Bulk Edit** to open the editor.
3. Adjust properties (as above), then click **Save**.

### Delete an agent

To delete agents:

## Domain Manager

On the **Domain Manager** tab, configure the domains for synchronization with OpenLM.

### Add a new sync domain

To add a domain:

1. Click **Add Domain**.
2. Fill in domain details:
   - **Domain type**: Active Directory, eDirectory, ApacheDS, AzureAD, or Google CDS.
   - **Domain name**: Hostname/IP of domain controller.
   - **Port**: Domain controller port.
   - **SSL**: Enable for encrypted connection.
   - **Username/Password**: Admin credentials (read access required).
   - **For Azure**: Domain Name, Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID.
   - For AzureAD synchronization, [consult this link](#).
   - For Google CDS synchronization, [consult this link](#).
3. Click **Check domain connectivity**, select the testing agent, and verify connectivity (up to 2 mins).
4. Click **Save** or **Save Domain & Add Sync**.

### Delete a domain

- Select domains, click **Delete**, confirm deletion.

> **Note:** Associated sync definitions must be deleted.

---

## Sync Manager

On the **Sync Manager** tab, configure synchronization definitions for selected domains.

### Add a new sync definition

1. Click **Add Sync**.
2. Fill in sync definition details:

- **Sync Name**: Unique name for the sync definition.
- **Status**: Enable or disable the sync.

#### Destination & Time tab

- **Agent**: Choose executing agent.
- **Domain name**: Domain to sync from.
- **Start node**: LDAP path node for sync starting point.  
  Examples:

LDAP://10.0.0.153/OU=OU_AB,DC=testdev1domain,DC=openlm,DC=biz
LDAP://server2008r2ldap.openlm.biz/CN=SecGroup,DC=openlm,DC=com

- **Sync schedule**:
- **By time**: Set specific days/times.
- **By interval**: Define intervals (1-720 hrs).

#### Object tab

- **Sync object type**: 
- Users (can limit to OpenLM monitored users).
- Computers (**Azure AD** supports **Users** only).
- **Sync attribute**: Directory attribute (e.g., cn, sAMAccountName, userPrincipalName).
- **Membership filter**: Sync all objects or only those in specific groups/OUs.
- **Search depth**: Limit depth of sync.

#### Group Rules tab

Set group synchronization rules:

- **No groups**: All objects assigned to default group.
- **Flat**: All objects assigned to one group.
- **Hierarchical**: Create groups according to directory hierarchy (OUs, Security groups, Distribution groups).
- **Entity attribute**: Create groups based on specified attributes.
- **Include start node**: Include or exclude the start node from sync.
- **Set as default group**: Overrides default group assignment for reporting.

> **ApacheDS note:** ApacheDS groups synchronize differently due to specific object classes and member definitions. [Details here](#).

#### Project Rules tab

Similar configuration as Group Rules, applied to projects:

- **No project**, **Flat**, **Hierarchical**, or attribute-based rules.
- **Set as default project**: Overrides default project assignment.

### Manually trigger synchronization

- Select sync definitions and click the sync icon to manually trigger sync.

### Reset entity-relationship data

- Select definitions and click the reset icon to clear relationship data without affecting user data.

### Stop Sync button

- Use **Stop Sync** if synchronization is stuck (e.g., in "Update OpenLM DB").

### Delete a sync definition

- Select sync definitions, click **Delete**, and confirm deletion.

> **Note:** Running synchronizations can't be deleted.

## Entities tab

View entities created by DSS sync:

- ID, entity name, type, last sync definition, and sync time.
- Filter and export entity data.
- **Ignore entities** from future synchronizations.
- **Manually synchronize entities** individually.
- View **entity relationships**.

---

## Relations tab

View entity relations, including agents, domains, associated syncs, parent entities, and last sync date.

- **Ignore** entities for specific sync definitions.

## Directory Sync with Global Catalog

The Global Catalog is a central repository in a multi domain Active Directory (AD) forest. It enables Directory Sync to retrieve essential information and structural data about users across domains. It includes general attributes about all objects within the forest.

## Key benefits

- Supports forest-wide searches across multiple domains
- Improves query performance for common attributes
- Simplifies access to multi domain environments

## Limitations

- Contains only a subset of object attributes
- Might not include detailed user properties

:::note
Because the Global Catalog doesn't include all user attributes, use caution when syncing. Some data might be missing.
:::

For example, the following attributes were not synced using the `GC://` protocol in Directory Sync Service (DSS):

- `title`
- `department`
- `mobile`
- `physicalDeliveryOfficeName`

These attributes were successfully synced when using the `LDAP://` protocol for the same entity.

## Configure Global Catalog in DSS

1. **Add the domain with the correct port:**
   - Port `3268` for non SSL connections
   - Port `3269` for SSL connections

2. **Set the start node:**
   - When creating a new sync, set the `startnode` to use the `GC` protocol instead of `LDAP`
