# Touch Points Events

## Overview

**Touch Points Events** reports how frequently users access registered URLs (including subdirectories) from workstations where OpenLM Workstation Agent is installed. The Workstation Agent automatically discovers accessed URLs and suggests them as candidates for monitoring. It tracks frequency of website visits rather than duration.

## Prerequisites

- **Agent Activity Manager**: Install Workstation Agent on all target machines.
- Configure settings in **Agents Hub** [Configuration guide](agents_hub.md).

## Register URLs for monitoring

Follow these steps to register URLs for monitoring:

1. In **Agents Hub**, review automatically discovered URLs.
2. Approve URLs to activate monitoring, or toggle off (deny) any that you don't want to monitor.
3. You can also manually add URLs (including subdirectories) to monitor specific websites.

After registration, view URL access frequency reports in **Touch Points Events**. 

- Filter reports by **username** or **workstation**.
