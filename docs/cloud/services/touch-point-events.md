# Touch Points Events

## Overview

**Touch Points Events** reports how frequently users access registered URLs (including subdirectories) from workstations where the OpenLM agent is installed. The agent automatically discovers accessed URLs and suggests them as candidates for monitoring. It tracks the frequency of website visits rather than the duration.

## Prerequisites

- **Agent Activity Manager**: Install agents on all target machines. ([Agent installation guide](Link))
- Configure settings in the **Agents Hub**. ([Configuration guide](Link))

## Register URLs for monitoring

Follow these steps to register URLs for monitoring:

1. In the **Agents Hub** microservice, review automatically discovered URLs.
2. Approve URLs to enable monitoring, or toggle off (deny) any that you don't want to monitor.
3. You can also manually add URLs (including subdirectories) to monitor specific websites.

After registration, view URL access frequency reports in the **Touch Points Events** .

- Filter reports by **username** or **workstation**.
