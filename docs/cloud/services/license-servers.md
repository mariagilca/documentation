# License Servers

## Overview

The **License Servers** section provides details about your monitored license servers, showing real-time license usage and server status. Use this section to efficiently manage and monitor connected license servers.

## Features

With License Servers, you can:

- View monitored license servers and real-time usage statistics.
- Review servers pending approval, then approve and merge them into your existing configuration, or deny servers you don't want to monitor.
- Restore previously denied servers by returning them to **Pending Servers** for reconsideration.
- Manage or delete existing license servers by hovering over the server row and selecting the **Edit** icon to enter editing mode.
